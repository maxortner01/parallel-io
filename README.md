# parallel-io
Meant to serve as a sandbox for testing parallel I/O file reading/writing for possible use as external driver library for [FleCSI](https://github.com/flecsi/flecsi) I/O.

Dependencies are not built in at the moment, but `spack add exodusii parallel-netcdf mpi` should do it.

For information about getting started or building, check out [the documentation](https://maxortner01.github.io/parallel-io).
